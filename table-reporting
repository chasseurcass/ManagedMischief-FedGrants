To effectively track late, rejected, and corrected submissions in your reporting table, you need to design the table with fields that capture these specific statuses and any related details. Here's how you can structure this in Microsoft Access:

1. **Create a Reporting Table**:
   - Open your database and create a new table in Design View.
   - This table will specifically track the status and details of report submissions for each grant.

2. **Defining Key Fields**:
   - **Report ID**: A unique identifier for each report (primary key).
   - **Grant CFDA Number**: Links the report to a specific grant.
   - **Report Type**: Identifies the type of report (e.g., Monthly, Quarterly, etc.).
   - **Due Date**: The date the report is due.
   - **Submission Date**: The actual date the report was submitted.
   - **Status**: A field to capture the current status of the report (e.g., Submitted, Late, Rejected, Corrected).
   - **Reason for Rejection**: If a report is rejected, this field can capture the reason why.
   - **Date Corrected**: The date on which a corrected report was submitted, if applicable.

3. **Tracking Late Reports**:
   - You can use a query or a calculated field to determine if a report is late. If the 'Submission Date' is after the 'Due Date', mark the report as Late.

4. **Handling Rejected Reports**:
   - If a report is rejected, the 'Status' field should be updated to 'Rejected', and the 'Reason for Rejection' field should be filled.
   - When a corrected report is submitted, update the 'Status' to 'Corrected' and record the 'Date Corrected'.

5. **Forms for Data Entry and Updates**:
   - Create forms for entering and updating report information. Ensure these forms allow for easy updating of the report status and related fields.

6. **Queries for Monitoring Reports**:
   - Design queries to filter reports by their status (Late, Rejected, Corrected) and other criteria. This allows for easy monitoring and follow-up.
   - You can also create queries to alert you to upcoming or overdue reports.

7. **Reports for Summary and Analysis**:
   - Generate reports from your database to provide summaries of report statuses, reasons for rejections, frequencies of corrections, etc.
   - These reports are useful for analysis and improving the reporting process.

8. **Data Validation and Integrity**:
   - Implement validation rules to ensure data consistency, such as preventing the entry of a 'Date Corrected' if the status is not 'Corrected'.

9. **Security and Compliance**:
   - Ensure that sensitive information in the reporting table is protected and that access is controlled based on user roles.

By setting up your reporting table in this manner, you will have a comprehensive system for tracking the status of each report, identifying issues, and ensuring that all reporting requirements are met efficiently.
