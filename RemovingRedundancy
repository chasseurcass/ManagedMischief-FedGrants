Thank you for providing the detailed structure of your proposed tables. I'll review them for redundancy, proper assignment of primary and foreign keys, and overall structure. Here's the feedback:

### Grant Information
- **Correct**: `Grant_ID` as a primary key is appropriate. Other fields are well-structured.
- **Suggestion**: Ensure `Grant_Region` is consistently used if relevant to other tables.

### Required Forms
- **Correct**: `Required_Form_ID` as a primary key; `Grant_ID` as a foreign key.
- **Suggestion**: Ensure `Form_Name` and `Form_Description` are distinct in purpose.

### Submitted Forms
- **Correct**: `Submission_ID` as a primary key; `Required_Form_ID` and `Grant_ID` as foreign keys.
- **Suggestion**: Make sure `Form_Submission_Status` covers all necessary statuses.

### Grantee Information
- **Correct**: `Grantee_ID` as a primary key; `Grant_ID` as a foreign key.
- **Redundancy**: `Region` might be redundant if it's always the same as `Grant_Region` in the `Grant Information` table.

### Personnel Log
- **Correct**: `Personnel_ID` as a primary key; `Grant_ID` as a foreign key.
- **Redundancy/Suggestion**: If `Region` is same as in `Grant Information`, consider removing it. `Year` may also be redundant if linked to a specific grant year.

### Risk Assessment
- **Correct**: `Assessment_ID` as a primary key; `Grantee_ID` as a foreign key.

### PD/FO Change Log
- **Correct**: `Change_ID` as a primary key; `Grant_ID` as a foreign key.
- **Redundancy**: `Region` and `Year` might be redundant if they are always derived from the grant.

### Financial Information
- **Correct**: `Financial_Record_ID` as a primary key; `Grantee_ID` as a foreign key.
- **Suggestion**: `Disbursement_Date` could be a separate table if multiple disbursement dates are needed per record.

### Expenditure Tracking
- **Correct**: `Expense_ID` as a primary key; `Grantee_ID` as a foreign key.
- **Suggestion**: `Related_Grant` could be redundant with `Grantee_ID` if each grantee is tied to one grant.

### Allowable Expenses
- **Correct**: `Allowable_Expenses_ID` as a primary key; `Grant_ID` as a foreign key.
- **Suggestion**: Ensure that `Year` and `Expense_Category` are clearly defined and used.

### Project Milestones
- **Correct**: `Milestone_ID` as a primary key; `Grantee_ID` as a foreign key.
- **Suggestion**: `Preceding_Milestone_ID` is good for tracking dependencies.

### Required Reports
- **Correct**: `Required_Report_ID` as a primary key; `Grant_ID` as a foreign key.
- **Suggestion**: `Reporting_Year` is useful; ensure it aligns with the grantâ€™s fiscal year.

### Report Log
- **Correct**: Use of `Grantee_ID` and `Report_Type` for tracking.
- **Suggestion**: Consider adding a primary key like `Report_Log_ID`.

### Grant Closeout
- **Correct**: `Grant_ID` and `Year` for identification.
- **Suggestion**: Consider adding a primary key like `Closeout_ID`.

### Meetings
- **Correct**: `Meeting_ID` as a primary key.
- **Suggestion**: Ensure `Purpose` is detailed enough to cover all meeting types.

### Attendance
- **Correct**: `Attendance_ID` as a primary key; `Event_ID` as a foreign key.
- **Suggestion**: Ensure `Event_Type` covers all necessary event categories.

### Communication Logs
- **Correct**: Use of `Date` and `Grantee_ID`.
- **Suggestion**: Consider adding a primary key like `Communication_Log_ID`.

### Training Requirements
- **Correct**: `Training_ID` as a primary key; `Grant_ID` as a foreign key.

### Training Completion Log
- **Correct**: `Completion_Log_ID` as a primary key; `Training_ID` and `Personnel_ID` as foreign keys.

**General Suggestions**:
- Consistently use primary and foreign keys for relational integrity.
- Avoid redundancy by not duplicating data that can be derived from existing relationships.
- Ensure data types and field lengths are appropriate for the data stored.
- Regularly review table relationships and data entry forms to maintain database efficiency and user-friendliness.

Your database design shows a good understanding of structuring relational databases, with appropriate use of primary and foreign keys. Reducing redundancy will streamline the database and improve performance.
