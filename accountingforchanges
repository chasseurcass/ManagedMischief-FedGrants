To account for changes in required forms per year for each grant in your database, you need a flexible structure that allows for annual updates. Here's an approach to handle this in Microsoft Access:

1. **Create a Table for Required Forms**:
   - This table will list all the forms required for each grant, potentially changing each year.
   - Fields might include Form ID (primary key), Grant CFDA Number, Form Name, Year, and any other relevant details.

2. **Include a Year Field**:
   - Add a 'Year' field to this table to specify the year for which the form is required.
   - This allows you to have multiple entries for the same form across different years.

3. **Create a Table for Form Submissions**:
   - This is separate from the table listing required forms. It tracks actual submissions.
   - Include fields like Submission ID, Form ID (linking to the Required Forms table), Submission Date, and Status.

4. **Linking Required Forms to Submissions**:
   - Establish a relationship between the Required Forms table and the Form Submissions table using the Form ID.
   - This way, you can track which forms have been submitted each year and which are pending.

5. **Updating Required Forms Annually**:
   - At the start of each year (or grant cycle), update the Required Forms table to reflect the forms needed for that year.
   - This may involve adding new records for new forms, updating existing records, or marking certain forms as no longer required.

6. **Queries for Tracking and Reporting**:
   - Create queries to report on forms required for a specific year, forms submitted, and forms pending.
   - These queries can filter records based on the Year field and the status of submissions.

7. **Forms for Data Management**:
   - Design user-friendly forms in Access for managing required forms and tracking submissions.
   - These forms can help in entering and updating data related to required forms and their submissions.

8. **Handling Form Changes**:
   - When forms change (are added, removed, or modified), update the Required Forms table accordingly.
   - Ensure that historical data is maintained for reference.

9. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Regularly review the list of required forms and the submissions to ensure compliance with the updated requirements.

10. **Data Validation and Integrity**:
    - Implement data validation rules to ensure that form submissions correspond to the required forms for the correct year.

By setting up your database in this way, you can effectively manage the changing requirements for grant forms on a year-by-year basis, ensuring accurate and up-to-date tracking of all necessary documentation.
