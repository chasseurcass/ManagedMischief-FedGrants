To format the Grantee IDs for the other grants in a consistent and structured manner, you can follow a similar approach to the one used for the grants under the same CFDA number. The goal is to ensure uniqueness and easy identification of each grantee across all grants. Here's a general approach:

1. **Standard Format for Grantee IDs**:
   - Decide on a standard format that can be applied across all grants. This format should include elements that uniquely identify each grant and grantee.

2. **Elements of the Grantee ID**:
   - **CFDA Number**: Start with the CFDA number, as it is a primary identifier for the grant type.
   - **Grant-Specific Identifier**: If you have multiple grants under the same CFDA number (like the regional distinctions you mentioned), include a short code or abbreviation that distinguishes each grant.
   - **Unique Sequential Number**: Add a unique sequential number or code for each grantee within a specific grant. This ensures that each Grantee ID is unique.

3. **Example Format**:
   - A Grantee ID might look something like `10.001-PSN-E-001`. Here, `10.001` is the CFDA number, `PSN-E` indicates the PSN grant in the East region, and `001` is a unique number for the grantee.
   - For grants without regional or other subdivisions, you might use a format like `10.002-NFISA-001`, where `10.002` is the CFDA number, `NFISA` indicates the specific grant, and `001` is the unique grantee number.

4. **Implementing in Access**:
   - Use a combination of calculated fields, forms, and possibly VBA code to automate the generation of these IDs based on the format you’ve designed.
   - Include validation rules to ensure that each Grantee ID adheres to your format and maintains uniqueness.

5. **Handling Changes and Additions**:
   - Consider how you’ll manage changes or additions to grants. For instance, if a new region is added to a grant, you’ll need to adjust your ID format to accommodate this.

6. **Documentation and Training**:
   - Document your Grantee ID system clearly, explaining the format and the rationale behind it.
   - Train staff who will be entering or managing this data to understand and correctly use the Grantee ID system.

This structured approach to creating Grantee IDs will help maintain order and consistency in your database, making it easier to manage, search, and report on grantee information.
